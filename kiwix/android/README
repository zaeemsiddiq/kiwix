Kiwix is an offline reader for Web content. It's especially thought to
make Wikipedia available offline.  This is done by reading the content
of the project stored in a file format ZIM, a high compressed open
format with additional meta-data.

*********************************************************************
************* COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR ANDROID ******************
*********************************************************************

Android is just an additional target but you can still build for
Android only from a Linux or Mac (it cross-compiles).

* ./autogen.sh

* ./configure --disable-staticbins --disable-manager --disable-server --disable-launcher --disable-indexer --disable-installer --disable-searcher --disable-reader --disable-components --enable-android --enable-compileall

* cd src/dependencies && make android-deps && cd -

* cd android && ./build-android-with-native.py (If you have problem with aapt on a 64bits Linux, you might have to install 32 libsm on Ubuntu: lib32gcc1, lib32stdc++6, lib32z1)

To install the newly created APK on your device, use the following script:
./android/install-kiwix-on-device.sh

== Android Custom App ==

Android Custom App are single-content Kiwix-android clones. Those app
are tied to a single content and CAN NOT open other zim file. As well,
bundled zim files are not readable by the regular Kiwix app. Custom
App have specific branding.

Custom App are either compiled as embed (ZIM file is included in APK)
or are accompanied by a ZIM file.

* Embedded versions can be very large (while Play Store have a 50MB
  limit)
* Non-embedded versions are small (6MB) but require a companion ZIM file
  which can be up to 2GB.
* Companion file is a feature of the Play store.
