This is the procedure to build your own Kiwix/Moulinwiki DVD Windows
installer. This installer is necessary to copy data and binary files
from the DVD to the user HD easily and setup the application menu on
the user system.

"make-installer.rb" is a ruby script. This script is a wrapper over
NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System). The output file is called
'kiwix-setup.exe'.

Please follow the steps in the given order.

== Prepare ==

* Download Ruby here: http://download.kiwix.org/dev/ruby186-26.exe and
  install it in the default proposed directory: C:\ruby\

* Download NSIS: http://download.kiwix.org/dev/nsis-2.46-setup.exe and
  install it in the default proposed directory: C:\Program Files\NSIS\

* Download the following file, unpack and run install.exe
  http://download.kiwix.org/dev/nsis_locate.zip

* Download the following file, unpack it and copy UAC.nsh into your
  Include directory (e.g. C:\Program Files\NSIS\Include) and UAC.dll
  from Release/A into your Plugins directory (e.g. C:\Program
  Files\NSIS\Plugins).

* Install this self-extracting MSYS package on your system in the
  default proposed directory: C:\msys\1.0. A the end a console will be
  launched. Please answer "y" two times. After that you need to give
  the Qt SDK MinGW path: c:/Qt/2010.01/mingw. Enter "y" a last time
  and the MSYS installation will be finished.

== Compile ==

* Start MSYS, an icon should be present on your desktop. Otherwise
  start C:\msys\1.0\msys.bat

* Go to your code directory in "moulinkiwix/installer/" like
  following: cd /c/your_path_to_the_code/moulinkiwix/installer/

* Add the ruby and NSIS bin directory to the path like following:
  export PATH=$PATH:/c/ruby/bin:/c/Program\ Files/NSIS/

* Now you can run the make-installer.rb script to build your
  installer. For that you need to give the path of the directory which
  has exactly the file hierarchy like the DVD. Do like following:
  ruby.exe make-installer.rb --path=/c/your_dvd_path

== Run ==

* You have to install the kiwix-setup.exe installer in the /install/
  directory on the DVD file hierarchy. This is really essential to
  copy it there, because by running the installer, files will be
  copied relatively to its (the installer) position in the DVD file
  system.

* To run the installer simply double click on the
  "installer/kiwix-install.exe" binary and it should work.
